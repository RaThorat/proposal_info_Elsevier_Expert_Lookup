1. Example list proposals information from expert Lookup 'Proposal Upload Example.xlsx'
a. Put worksheets 'Suggested reviewers' and 'country sheet' from 'Proposal Upload Example.xlsx' as separate Excel files
b. Manually fill the 'Suggested reviewers' Excel with information, if available for the entire set of proposals
2. Proposals information pivot table from funding organisation data warehouse for the entire set of proposals or the SQL query which creates the proposals information
