# proposal_info_Elsevier_Expert_Lookup
Funding organisations who use Elsevier Expert Lookup for searching reviewers for subsidy applications manually place proposals information per subsidy round in the Expert Lookup. That takes a lot of time and energy. By automatically placing the proposals information in the Expert Lookup, funding organisations can save a lot of time. Elsevier Expert Lookup provides format in which it can take the lumsum proposals information. This code provides missing gap, where the lumsum proposals information from funding organisation is converted into the required format.
